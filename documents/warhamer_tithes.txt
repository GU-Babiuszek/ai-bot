Space Marines are exempt from the majority of Imperial tithes (left to govern their own worlds independently in line with the ancestral oaths of their Chapter), but even the mighty Adeptus Astartes must make their own sacrifices against the Necrons in the name of loyalty, and to ensure the futures of their Chapters.
